A JS object is just a collection of named values. These named values are usually referred to as
properties of te object.
An object can be created with curly brackets {} with an optional list of properties. A property is a
"key: value" pair, where key(or property name) is always a string, and value(or property value) can
be datatype, like strings, numbers, booleans or arrays, functions, and other objects.
